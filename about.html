                            <p class="aboutmetext">I'm a designer and a front-end developer creating responsive designs to be easily adaptable for both desktop and mobile devices.  I'm inspired by Mid-Century Modern and Bauhaus designs due to their attention to details and simplicity.  This lends to my designs being clean and minimal, to focus on content and communication.</p>
