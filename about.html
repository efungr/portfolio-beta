                            My design tends to more minimal and clean.  I like to keep my designs  smart, intuitive but not boring.  It's also fun to research different art periods/eras and work those into digital designs.  So, it's always fun to work on any projects in which I putting a specific era into the design.  If you're inclined, please take a look at my resume.
