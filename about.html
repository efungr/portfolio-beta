If you were Google searching my name but was looking for the Pianist or Doctor, this is not the Eric Fung you're looking for.

                            <p class="aboutmetext">I'm a designer and a front-end developer creating responsive designs for both the big and small screens.  I'm inspired by Mid-Century Modern and Bauhaus designs due to their interesting details and simplicity.  This lends to my designs being clean and minimal, to focus on the content and communication.</p>
